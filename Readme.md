# fruit
This is a very simple project made by a very simple gal with a very simple task of getting to grips with ncurses. Simple, eh.

## Install
Make sure you have the right build tools (GNU C compiler and linker, make)
```
git clone https://github.com/fl3ur/fruit.git
cd fruit
make
```
You can then run the generated fruit executable (you may need to edit the Makefile on Windows to generate a `.exe` executable)
